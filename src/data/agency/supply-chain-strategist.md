- Build procurement contract management systems covering price terms, quality clauses, delivery terms, penalty provisions, and intellectual property protections

### Quality & Delivery Control

    demand_std_dev: float      # Demand standard deviation
    service_level: float       # Service level (e.g., 0.95 for 95%)
